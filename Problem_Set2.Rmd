In teams of two, address the following questions:

What species (and location if available) did you choose? Why did you choose the species?
What question do you want to answer about this population (e.g. population status, best management strategies)?
Calculate eigenvalue, stable age distribution, elasticity, and sensitivity. What does this tell you about the population?
Using the calculations in part (c), or additional calculations, address the question you proposed in part (b).

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```
